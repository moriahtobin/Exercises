		<li> Step 1: There is text on the page</li>
		<li>Step 3: New whitespace syntax -> enter p!</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Don't be distraught!</strong> <br> You aren't looking at 		 Step 2 now, <br>but it's in the <em>source code</em> ^.^</p>
	<!-- p separates text into chunks that can be separated, and <br>
	 keeps the text in it's p wrapper as one unit don't use <br> for 
	 text you would resonably want to separate. Note "reasonable" will
	 probably shift meaning based on the experience level of the author
	 (i.e. I am currently unsure if the <br> above is in line with best
	 practices, so I added a second that I was more sure about)-->

	<h2>Notes of Interest</h2>
	<p>There are two line breaks &ltp&gt,&lt/p&gt and &ltbr&gt. The first allows the text to be separated (maybe by a picture? we'll see!) and the second keeps the text together as one unit like a stanza in a poem. </p>
	<p> id's can be added to tags so that you can reference them on other parts of the page. This is the syntax for page teleportations #intraSiteTeleportation  </p>
	<p>Hilarious aside to my personal history, it seems that the <abbr title="Digital Optical Modules">DOMs</abbr> that I am used to are not the <abbr title="Document Object Models">DOMs</abbr> of web developers. <abbr title="Digital Optical Modules">DOMs</abbr> are the downward-facing <abbr title="Photomultiplier Tubes">PMTs</abbr> (light detectors) that record the particle interactions on the <a href='http://icecube.wisc.edu/about/overview'>IceCube Neutrino Observatory</a> (where I did my graduate work). </p>
	<h2>Random Thoughts Occuring</h2>
	<p>I'm excited about identifying the html literal syntax, so I can refer to p,/p in thier proper brackets (&lt, &gt). Obviously I've found a solution involving an ampersand (&amp) and lt or gt, presumably standing for less than and greater than (which is to say &amplt renders &lt and &ampgt renders &gt).  </p>
