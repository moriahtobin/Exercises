	<h1>The HTML Starter Process</h1>
	<hr></hr>
	<ul>
		<li> Step 1: There is text on the page</li>
		<li>Step 3: New whitespace syntax -> enter p!</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Don't be distraught!</strong> <br> You aren't looking at 		 Step 2 now, <br>but it's in the <em>source code</em> ^.^</p>
	<!-- p separates text into chunks that can be separated, and <br>
	 keeps the text in it's p wrapper as one unit don't use <br> for 
	 text you would resonably want to separate. Note "reasonable" will
	 probably shift meaning based on the experience level of the author
	 (i.e. I am currently unsure if the <br> above is in line with best
	 practices, so I added a second that I was more sure about)-->

	<h2>Notes of Interest</h2>
	<p>There are two line breaks &ltp&gt,&lt/p&gt and &ltbr&gt. The first allows the text to be separated (maybe by a picture? we'll see!) and the second keeps the text together as one unit like a stanza in a poem. </p>
	<p> id's can be added to tags so that you can reference them on other parts of the page. This is the syntax for page teleportations #intraSiteTeleportation  </p>
	<p>Hilarious aside to my personal history, it seems that the <abbr title="Digital Optical Modules">DOMs</abbr> that I am used to are not the <abbr title="Document Object Models">DOMs</abbr> of web developers. <abbr title="Digital Optical Modules">DOMs</abbr> are the downward-facing <abbr title="Photomultiplier Tubes">PMTs</abbr> (light detectors) that record the particle interactions on the <a href='http://icecube.wisc.edu/about/overview'>IceCube Neutrino Observatory</a> (where I did my graduate work). </p>
	<p>So it turns out there are two "cite"s": <code> &ltblockquote <var>cite</var> = "URL"&gt</code> which is a hidden cite attribute seen mainly by search engines behind the scenes, and <code>&ltp&gtI just learned something sweet in &ltcite&gtBook Title&lt/cite&gt&lt/p&gt</code>, the cite tag which is used to reference the title of a creative work.</p>
	<p>&ltpre&gt seems like an essential tag for python code, since it keeps track of white space of the text inside.</p>
	<h2>Random Thoughts Occuring</h2>
	<p>I'm excited about identifying the html literal syntax, so I can refer to p,/p in thier proper brackets (&lt, &gt). Obviously I've found a solution involving an ampersand (&amp) and lt or gt, presumably standing for less than and greater than (which is to say &amplt renders &lt and &ampgt renders &gt).  </p>
	<h3>Tests That Take up Quite Some Space</h3>
	<blockquote cite="http://www.nerudadoc.com/neruda_explain_things.html">
	<p><strong>I'll Explain Some Things</strong></p>
	<p>by Pablo Neruda</p>
	<p>You will ask: And where are the lilacs? 	<br>
	And the metaphysics laced with poppies? <br>
	And the rain that often beat <br>
	his words filling them with holes and birds? <br>  </p>
	<p>I'll tell you everything that's happening with me. </p>
	<p>[...] </p>
	<p>Jackals the jackal would reject <br>
	stones the dry thistle would bite then spit out <br>
	vipers the vipers would despise!</p>
	<p>Facing you I have seen the blood <br>
	of Spain rise up <br>
	to drown you in one single wave <br>
	of pride and knives!</p>
	<p>Traitor <br>
	generals: <br>
	behold my dead house <br>
	behold Spain destroyed <br>	
	yet instead of flowers from every dead house <br>
	burning metal flows <br>
	from every hollow of Spain <br>
	Spain flows <br>
	from every dead child rises a rifle with eyes <br>
	from every crime bullets are born <br>
	that one day will find the target <br>
	of your heart.</p>
	<p>You will ask why his poetry <br>
	doesn't speak to us of dreams, of the leaves <br>
	of the great volcanoes of his native land?</p>
	<p>Come and see the blood in the streets <br>
	come and see <br>
	the blood in the streets <br>
	come and see the blood <br>
	in the streets!</p>
